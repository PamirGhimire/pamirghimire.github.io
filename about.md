I am Pamir, an engineer interested in computer vision, robotics and 
software development. 

I am fascinated with modern technology. I think computers and the internet, along with open-source software (like Linux) are the greatest tools that my generation has (and are completely awesome).

I also maintain an interest in climate change, demographics, and supply chains. 

Write to me if you'd like to reach out. Cheers,
